title: Prevent route leaks by explicitly defining policy

Route leaks or even hijacks are one of the biggest flaws in global routing.

What are the route leaks? Literally, there are prefixes announced accidentally due to wrongly configured import/export filters. Or those filters do not exist at all.

If a customer or a peer sends routes outside his scope and a provider accepts them, we call those events as route leaks.

Route leaks are more referred to accidentally events, while hijacks are an illegitimate takeover of IP addresses by corrupting routing tables. In such a case, scammers can route the traffic as he wishes. To avoid the aforementioned events providers MUST take care of strict filters what to accept from peers and customers.

Most known filters are:

* Use [RPKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure) to validate the prefix (ROA - Route Origin Authorisation);
* Use _prefix-list_ to accept only defined ranges;
* Use _distribute-list_ for the same reason as above;
* Use as-path access-lists (_filter-list_) to filter out by _AS-PATH_ attribute;
* Set _maximum-prefix_ for a peer or a customer to avoid overfilling the Adj-RIBs-In. But this is too much aggressive if one side decides to restart the session under some circumstances;
* Accept prefixes only defined in WHOIS database (RIPE, APNIC, etc.). Usually, this is a periodic job to fetch, aggregate and push those lists to devices. That's why it takes even a few days for some ISPs.

Another interesting approach I found is by implementing roles where each neighbor defines the role: customer, peer, internal, provider. This approach appends `BGP Open message` to establish an agreement of the relationship of two neighbors. Propagated routes are then marked with iOTC (The Internal Only To Customer)] attribute according to agreed relationship allowing prevention of route leaks.

More about that you can read on [htt ps://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy-02](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy-02).

We discussed this draft in short in the FRRouting group, but at the moment there is nothing to implement while it's not released as RFC. And this draft
is questionable if it would give any reasonable effect right now. It would take a huge amount of time to implement for both sides. It's absolutely fine if you use only [FRRouting daemons](https://frrouting.org/), but what about a vendor-agnostic solution?

Instead of using roles in updates and open messages, I found [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8212](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8212) which sounds reasonable to implement.

The RFC defines that both peering sides should require import/exporter filters explicitly defined. What does it mean? By default, all(?) vendors do not require route-map to be configured for a neighbor.

The snippet below will announce everything it has in its _Adj-RIB-Out_ for neighbor 192.168.3.1.

```
router bgp 65031
 neighbor 192.168.3.1 remote-as 65032
 !
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  redistribute connected
 exit-address-family
!
```

[Here](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/pull/3746) we have a new BGP `bgp ebgp-requires-policy` knob which requires filters (filter-list, distribute-list, prefix-list or route-map defined) for every eBGP session.

![](/images/rfc8212.gif)

```
router bgp 65031
 bgp ebgp-requires-policy
 neighbor 192.168.3.1 remote-as 65032
 !
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  redistribute connected
  neighbor 192.168.3.1 prefix-list exit4-in in
  neighbor 192.168.3.1 route-map exit4-out out
 exit-address-family
!
ip prefix-list exit4-in permit 10.0.0.0/24
!
route-map exit4-out permit 10
!
```

To clarify, if we remove inbound prefix-list from this neighbor, we will receive zero prefixes due to default behavior.

```
router bgp 65031
 bgp ebgp-requires-policy
 neighbor 192.168.3.1 remote-as 65032
 !
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  redistribute connected
  neighbor 192.168.3.1 route-map exit4-out out
 exit-address-family
!
route-map exit4-out permit 10
!
```

Adj-RIB-In table for neighbor 192.168.3.1 will be equal to zero prefixes. It prevents accepting any prefixes if the policy is forgotten to define explicitly.

Even though we see an informational warning that _Inbound updates discarded due to missing policy_ under `show bgp neighbors 192.168.3.1`.

Hence, instead of just reading the documentation, itâ€™s more fun to play archeologist and try to implement this into real-life examples. An attempt to cool again.
