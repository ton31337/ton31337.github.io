When I talked in [SRECon16Europe](https://www.usenix.org/node/193520) last year with one engineer from [Booking.com](http://booking.com), he mentioned they are planning to launch TCP Fast Open in server farm under L3 load balancing (ECMP). 

I asked if you are deploying TFO in production? The first answer was: "We don't because we don't know how to manage TFO key between application nodes". 

Then the question came in my mind: "Why not sync them using automation tools or do this periodically e.g. inserting timestamp inside the cookie?". 

Today I recall this case and wanted to try it to see how it behaves in reality. I won't dig into abstractions how it works and how to enable it for clients and servers. This [post](https://bradleyf.id.au/nix/shaving-your-rtt-wth-tfo/) is very useful if you need basic information how TFO works. I will describe other useful things they aren't covered in the previously mentioned post.

#### Verify if TFO is working

The first tool to verify if it's working is `tcpdump`:

With TFO:

```
07:03:45.442747 IP 1.1.1.1.41360 > 2.2.2.2.81: Flags [S], seq 3248579141:3248579160, win 29200, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 0 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7,unknown-34 0x2cc5086de402d86a,nop,nop], length 19
07:03:45.442876 IP 2.2.2.2.81 > 1.1.1.1.41360: Flags [S.], seq 1989043609, ack 3248579161, win 28960, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 37965533 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
07:03:45.443034 IP 1.1.1.1.41360 > 2.2.2.2.81: Flags [.], ack 1, win 229, options [nop,nop,TS val 1277090187 ecr 37965533], length 0
```

Without TFO (regular 3WHS):

```
19:36:19.471384 IP 1.1.1.1.62248 > 2.2.2.2.81: Flags [S], seq 1237548774, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 5,nop,nop,TS val 932576322 ecr 0,sackOK,eol], length 0
19:36:19.471483 IP 2.2.2.2.81 > 1.1.1.1.62248: Flags [S.], seq 3862688090, ack 1237548775, win 28960, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 83119562 ecr 932576322,nop,wscale 7], length 0
19:36:19.478781 IP 1.1.1.1.62248 > 2.2.2.2.81: Flags [.], ack 1, win 4117, options [nop,nop,TS val 932576329 ecr 83119562], length 0
```

You should notice `unknown-34 0x2cc5086de402d86a` part in the first output and `length 19`, which means, that SYN packets arrive with data (19 bytes) and the cookie for TFO is `0x2cc5086de402d86a`. The second example shows regular 3-way handshake for TCP without TFO option. In my example, `SYN-ACK` doesn't have any data, because I'm not using any application which response to requests.

#### TFO Queue Length

In this case, I installed HAProxy which has support for TFO but looks like there isn't any simple way to monitor TFO queues. With stap, you are able to catch as usually almost everything.

```
probe kernel.statement("tcp_fastopen_queue_check@net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen.c:234")
{
        if ($fastopenq->qlen)
                printf("%d/%d\n", $fastopenq->qlen, $fastopenq->max_qlen);
}
```

Produced output:

```
4/2000
5/2000
```

#### A little few bits about how TCP options are handled by TCP/IP stack in Kernel

Let's talk about this option, which is defined in [RFC7413](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7413):

```

                                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   |      Kind     |    Length     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   ~                            Cookie                             ~
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Kind            1 byte: value = 34
   Length          1 byte: range 6 to 18 (bytes); limited by
                           remaining space in the options field.
                           The number MUST be even.
   Cookie          0, or 4 to 16 bytes (Length - 2)
```

I started to dig in `net/ipv4/tcp_input.c` to see how those TCP options are handled at all, because didn't understand what `Kind`, `Length` mean.

The function I was interested is:

```
void tcp_parse_options(const struct sk_buff *skb,
                       struct tcp_options_received *opt_rx, int estab,
                       struct tcp_fastopen_cookie *foc)
```

Looking into the code isn't so much informative without opening another [ilustrated](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/tcp.htm) tab. 

All TCP options are put instantly after TCP header, thus this `ptr = (const unsigned char *)(th + 1);` moves pointer where options start. 

OK, we have the pointer to options, now we need to parse those options one-by-one. `int opcode = *ptr++;` leads to aforementioned `Kind`. 

Later we have a loop iterating over all options by `opsize = *ptr++;` which is offset defined as `Length`. 

And now we have `Cookie`. Iterate over the options until you find `TCPOPT_FASTOPEN` (this is what we saw in tcpdump unknown-34):

```
                        case TCPOPT_FASTOPEN:
                                tcp_parse_fastopen_option(
                                        opsize - TCPOLEN_FASTOPEN_BASE,
                                        ptr, th->syn, foc, false);
                                break;
```

This calls `tcp_parse_fastopen_option` appropriately and copies cookie value to `tcp_fastopen_cookie` struct for further processing, which is under `net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen.c`. Then everything is almost clear like defined in RFC:

```
struct sock *tcp_try_fastopen(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb,
                              struct request_sock *req,
                              struct tcp_fastopen_cookie *foc,
                              struct dst_entry *dst)
```

#### Ok, but why is TFO the enemy for firewalls?

Firewalls in the middle of connections could cause TFO stuck in transport - blackhole. This could happen for instance in such scenarios:

* Firewalls drop SYN packets with payload;
* Firewalls drop SYN/ACK packets with payload in 3WHS.

As a result, the connection will stale for a long time and client will hang up.

This is solvable by introducing `tcp_fastopen_blackhole_timeout_sec` sysctl which will grow the time exponentially to disable active TFO. It will decrease this time when the TFO is back to normal again.

#### Sum up

* `ip tcp_metrics show` command is useful in some cases;
* `nstat` is useful to see some TFO activity;
* TFO is not so popular yet, but it's acquiring velocity (e.g.: TLS 1.3 (False Start))
