title: Overwrite PHP settings on the fly with mod_reset
categories:

mod_reset is a module for both Apache versions including 2.2 and 2.4. It simply looks at headers you set in Apache configuration and overwrites PHP settings. Let's say we want to set `memory_limit` dynamically for certain application, Apache configuration looks like this:

```
ResetHeaders "memory_limit" "X-Memory-Limit"
```

This snippet translates to Look at `X-Memory-Limit` HTTP header and set value from this header to PHP `memory_limit`. You might wonder why use this module while there are other solutions like `mod_fcgid`, `mod_lsapi`? Because we want to use `mod_php`, run single PHP version per container and have a reverse proxy in front of this fleet of containers. Secondly, `mod_fcgid` is not developed anymore, while `mod_lsapi` has to run under CloudLinux which is proprietary and not free.

In addition, this module allows you to overwrite `DocumentRoot`, `ServerAdmin` and `TMPDIR` environment on request from headers too. For instance:

```
ResetHeader "ServerAdmin" "X-Server-Admin"
ResetHeader "DocumentRoot" "X-Document-Root"
```

Setting `TMPDIR` environment per request allows you to make sure client is not using `/tmp` anymore for temporary files, thus files quota will be calculated more granularly.
