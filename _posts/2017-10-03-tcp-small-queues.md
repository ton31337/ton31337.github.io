I was always interested in receive (RX) side when handling the packets (dunno why), but when you dig into the congestion avoidance situations you MUST pay more attention to sending side (TX).

I read about BBR (the quite new congestion algorithm) invented by Google and there are a couple of interesting moving parts involved like TSO, TSQ, pacing, fair queuing before proceeding to NIC. All of those are well known but TSQ was untouched for me, though. So I decided to take a deeper look about TSQ and how it works internally.

>When sockets send and receive packets, they must be properly charged for the amount of system memory consumed by that packet. BSD sockets have the concept of send and receive buffers, which are used to keep track of this and make sure sockets stay within their limits.

Allocated memory constraints for the socket are set by using `sk->sk_sndbuf`/`sk->sk_rcvbuf`. This means you cannot buffer more data than socket allows. You send the packet to the socket and allocated memory which resides in `skb->truesize` + `struct sk_buff` overhead is accumulated using `atomic_add(skb->truesize, &sk->sk_wmem_alloc);` and vice versa `atomic_sub(skb->truesize - 1, &sk->sk_wmem_alloc);` substracted from `sk_wmem_allow` accordingly.

Looks very simple and nice. TSQ just works together with TSO as an additional layer to make absorption as little as needed. In short, it sits between TSO and qdisk+device queues to make sure latencies are much lower and to avoid bufferbloat circumstances. Without TSQ, TSO (basically allows putting more than 66560 bytes into a single packet) could grow the packets (1M or more), which could lead to high latencies.

While I didn't find anything useful about tuning or so for TSQ, I decided to look further. The best way to learn something is as always - look at the code.

This proves that TSQ really works as expected. TSO no more adds huge packets in flight thus reducing latencies.

#### So?

Does it require any further tuning? I don't think so unless you really like do (un)tune something. One needs specialized deep knowledge â€” it's best to have Eric Dumazet available ;-)
