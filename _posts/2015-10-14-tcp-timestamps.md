I'm sure most of you do not understand what is TCP timestamps and how they are used by linux kernel. I wasn't too, thus decided to figure it out. It looks like TCP timestamps are important for these days kernels, because they have modern delay-gradient congestion control algorithms and so on. More details you can find in [highscalability.com](http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/14/save-some-bandwidth-by-turning-off-tcp-timestamps.html) post.
