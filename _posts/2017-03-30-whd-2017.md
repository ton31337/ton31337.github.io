title: Takeaways from World Hosting Days 2017 Europe

This was the third time I was visiting [WHD](http://worldhostingdays.com/global/). I could freely say that the format of this event doesn't change over the years. It's neither worse nor better.

My daughter asked me to bring a big car (pink) from Germany as a gift. I'm not successful in the lottery, but this time was different. I was applied to the lottery to win huge [Lego](https://shop.lego.com/de-DE/The-Tumbler-76023) (Batman's car - unfortunately black). Guess what happened. A few hours later I got an email:

```
Dear Donatas,
Thank you for joining our prize draw today. You have won the 1st prize the Lego Batman Tumbler!
Congratulations on behalf of the Dell EMC Team.
```

So, it can't be unsuccessful every time, it was my day - perhaps first time (or second) I won something in my history.

* One of the most interesting stuff was [Intel Optane](http://www.intel.eu/content/www/eu/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-memory.html) memory, which could be used as a storage or could be extended as DRAM.

* [Imunify360](https://imunify360.com/) told `inotify()` sucks. I could correct this: it already does not suck anymore since `FAN_MODIFY_DIR` flag was introduced for `fanotify()` syscall, which reports all events per directory basis and does it recursively.

* [Litespeed](https://www.litespeedtech.com/) promoted his product honestly with unknown benchmarks. In short comparing with Nginx, Apache Litespeed overruns aforementioned in all aspects including caching, balancing, etc. I asked how did you achieve these results, what kind of secrets you are using to obviously wake those benchmarks. I could, of course, ask if you are using some kind of low-level micro performance optimizations like pointer tagging, but I just stopped myself from asking tech questions to marketing and/or sales guys. It would be too much offending, IMO. TLDR: this sounds more like "LittleSpeed".

* [DNS RPZ](https://dnsrpz.info/) is trending as an additional layer of protection for DNS. This looks promising, but still in progress. Some of the well-known DNS servers have support (e.g. PowerDNS, Bind), but it would take some time to be RFC'ed globally.

* Connection party was awesome. It really exceeded my expectations including live music concert with top music stars like ZZ Top, Black Sabbath, Guns N' Roses, etc.

* The last day as usually was dedicated to attractions, but unfortunately most of the coasters didn't work, despite perfect weather conditions.

To conclude all these things: it's an amazing place to meet new people which have a lot of attractions, free parties, free food and drinks, a lot of fun and so on and so on. Just relax and enjoy the spring with some background of spam in the middle of nowhere (Rust, Germany) ðŸ™‚
